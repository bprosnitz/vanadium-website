Vanadium supports writing secure and distributed applications in Java.

By using the [Vanadium Definition Language][vdl] (VDL), Vanadium apps written in
Java can also communicate with Vanadium servers and clients written in other
languages.

Unlike other tutorials, the Java tutorials do not require a Vanadium
installation.
